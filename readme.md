## Problem Context

Clean water is the foundation of every healthy civilization, yet many nations still lack robust and sophisticated infrastructure to address demand.  Machine Learning can be a valuable toolset to assist in the production and distribution of clean water â€“ especially when the treatment or distribution methods are decentralized. 


## Dataset & Problem Overview

Can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all?  Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
The data for this competition comes from the Tarifa, a platform which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.


## Submission Requirements

All submissions should consist of 4 distinct artifacts
- test set predictions.  This file should be formated according the example given in the 'SubmissionFormat.csv'
- code base used to produce the predictions
- the description and online location of supplemental data sources used to produce the predicions (if any)
- presentation powerpoint

E-mail these artifiacts to nwhite@aimconsulting.com before the end of competition time: Thursday, February 13th @ 5:00 PM CT


## Evaluation Metric

The submitted predictions will be evaluated with multi-class log-loss score.  An exaplantion of this metric can be found here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html


## Presentation Format

While the team prizes will be determined exclusively by the 'evaluation metric' the presentation is your opportunity to share your results and thought process with the judges, all of whom are industry veterans.  Think of this as an opportunity to network and learn from local practioners.

At a minimum each presentation should include:

1.) Team Intro
2.) Results
3.) Approach
4.) Biggest Challenges
5.) Lessons learned
