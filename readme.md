## Problem Context

Clean water is the foundation of every healthy civilization, yet many nations still lack robust and sophisticated infrastructure to address demand.  Machine Learning can be a valuable toolset to assist in the production and distribution of clean water â€“ especially when the treatment or distribution methods are decentralized. 


## Dataset & Problem Overview

Can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all?  Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
The data for this competition comes from the Tarifa, a platform which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.
